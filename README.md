## [Experimantal]

This repository is not ready to be used.
It just contains my thoughts about how a Hypermedia-API could be consumed by a WebClient.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install
# run tests
$ npm test
# build
$ npm run build
```

## Thanks

- The idea of how to consume Hypermedia APIs comes from [Alexander Zeitler](https://gist.github.com/AlexZeitler/7fd2a1ba8130d306526bf836b46b0813).
- This testsetup is inspired by the article [How to setup testing using Typescript, Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Karma and Webpack](https://templecoding.com/blog/2016/02/02/how-to-setup-testing-using-typescript-mocha-chai-sinon-karma-and-webpack/) by Thiago Temple.
